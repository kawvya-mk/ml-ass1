## �� Experiment 1: Working with Python Packages

### ✅ Aim

To understand and explore essential Python libraries used in machine learning, such as **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Scikit-learn**, for preprocessing, visualization, and model building.

---

## �� Libraries Used

- **NumPy**: For vectorized computations and internal math operations.
- **Pandas**: For data loading, preprocessing, and manipulation.
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting histograms, scatter plots, and evaluation visuals.
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization (e.g., heatmaps, boxplots).
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning models like Linear Regression and computing metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE, R²).

---

## �� Key Preprocessing Techniques

- **Handling Missing Values**: Imputation using mean/median; feature removal if too sparse.
- **Label Encoding**: Converting categorical features to numeric format.
- **Data Visualization**:
  - `heatmap()` for correlation matrix
  - Histogram and boxplot for distribution and outlier detection
- **Outlier Removal**:
  - Dropping outliers using IQR method
  - Replacing outliers with mean/median
- **Standardization**:
  - Applying `z = (x - µ) / σ` to scale features for uniformity
